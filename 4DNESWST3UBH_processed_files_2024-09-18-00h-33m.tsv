This duplication does not affect the higlass display of these files, howevver, downstream analyses using this file may encounter issues due to this pixel duplication.  The counts from the duplicate pixels can be aggregated to determine the correct count value at that location. If this issue is problematic for your needs you should consider regenerating the matrices from the merged pairs file of the associated dataset using a more recent version of cooler.  We are working to update the pipeline but do not yet have a predicted date for when this issue will be resolved.	https://4dn-open-data-public.s3.amazonaws.com/fourfront-webprod/wfoutput/27bbfb40-0224-427c-be41-398b43d70c48/4DNFI9FVHJZQ.mcool
